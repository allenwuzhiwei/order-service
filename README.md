# üõí Order MicroService - E-commerce Backend Module

## Overview
The **Order Service** is a core microservice within our e-commerce platform.  
It is responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of order-related data, including orders, order items, payments, and shipment tracking.

It is built with **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and follows a clean architecture with a layered structure.  
The service integrates with other microservices via **Eureka** (service discovery) and **Spring Cloud Config**.
